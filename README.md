# AutomataTheory


Building an Automate in Python, that gets a file that describes a deterministic automate
and the input is random characters or words.

The automate will answer whether the word belongs in the language of the automate or not.

-3         *The automate has 3 states*
-1         *The initial states is the 1*
-2         *There are 2 initial states*
-2 3       *The final states are the 2 and 3*
-6         *There are 6 transitions*
-1a2       *Description of the transitions. For example if the automate is in the state 1, and it reads*
-1b1       *the character 'a' it goes at the state 2.*
-2a3
-2b1
-3a3
